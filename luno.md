# Luno API (1.2.5)

Download OpenAPI specification:Download

The Luno API provides developers with a wealth of financial information provided through the Luno platform. Through this secure system developers can:

  * Create accounts for trading in cryptocurrencies
  * Access current and historic cryptocurrency market data
  * Submit trade orders and view order status
  * Buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum
  * Send and receive Bitcoin and Ethereum
  * Generate Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses



The Luno API brings the world of Bitcoin and Ethereum to your doorstep.

# [](#tag/Authentication)Authentication

Some API calls require your application to authenticate itself. This is done using an API key associated with your account. You can create an API key by visiting [the API Keys section](/wallet/settings/api_keys) on the settings page.

An API key consists of a `key id` and a `key secret`. For example, `cnz2yjswbv3jd` (key id) and `0hydMZDb9HRR3Qq-iqALwZtXLkbLR4fWxtDZvkB9h4I` (key secret).

API requests are authenticated using HTTP basic authentication with the key id as the username and the key secret as the password. A missing, incorrect or revoked key causes error 401 to be returned.

Each API key is granted a set of permissions when it is created. The key can only be used to call the permitted API functions.

### Permissions

The following is a list of the possible permissions.

  * `Perm_R_Balance = 1` (View balance)
  * `Perm_R_Transactions = 2` (View transactions)
  * `Perm_W_Send = 4` (Send to any address)
  * `Perm_R_Addresses = 8` (View addresses)
  * `Perm_W_Addresses = 16` (Create addresses)
  * `Perm_R_Orders = 32` (View orders)
  * `Perm_W_Orders = 64` (Create orders)
  * `Perm_R_Withdrawals = 128` (View withdrawals)
  * `Perm_W_Withdrawals = 256` (Create withdrawals)
  * `Perm_W_ClientDebit = 8192` (Debit accounts)
  * `Perm_W_ClientCredit = 16384` (Credit accounts)
  * `Perm_R_Beneficiaries = 32768` (View beneficiaries)
  * `Perm_W_Beneficiaries = 65536` (Create and delete beneficiaries)
  * `Perm_R_Transfers = 131072` (Create and delete beneficiaries)



A set of permissions is represented as the bitwise OR of each permission in the set. For example the set of permissions required to view balances and orders is `Perm_R_Balance | Perm_R_Orders = 33`.

When API keys are created, users can select permission sets that automatically include various permissions for their key. These are listed below.

Permission Set | Included Permissions  
---|---  
Read-only access  |  View Balance   
View transactions   
Send to any address   
View orders   
View withdrawals   
View beneficiaries   
View transfers   
Trading access  |  View Balance   
View transactions   
Send to any address

# [](#tag/Conventions)Conventions

Timestamps are always represented as an integer number of milliseconds since the `UTC Epoch` (a Unix timestamp).

Prices and volumes are always represented as a decimal strings e.g. "123.3432". Strings are used rather than floats to preserve the precision.

Parameters for POST calls are sent as URL-encoded forms (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).

# [](#tag/Libraries)Libraries

The [Go library](https://github.com/luno/luno-go) is the recommended way to access the API.

The following libraries were implemented by third parties or are no longer under active development and are listed here for convenience. No support is provided by Luno and they may be out of date. A thorough review of the code is recommended before including them in any project.

  * [Android](https://github.com/22sevengithub/bitx-android)
  * [Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bitx-bitcoin)
  * [Java](https://github.com/luno/luno-java)
  * [Node.js](https://npmjs.org/package/bitx)
  * [PHP](https://packagist.org/packages/luno/luno-php)
  * [Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/luno-python)
  * [Ruby](https://github.com/bitx/bitx-ruby)



# [](#tag/Rate-Limiting)Rate Limiting

APIs are rate limited to 300 calls per minute. Calls made in excess of this limit will receive a HTTP error `Code 429` response.

The streaming API is limited to 50 sessions open simultaneously. Calls in excess of this limit will receive a `session limit exceeded` message.

# [](#tag/Security)Security

Always use HTTPS when calling the API. Non-TLS HTTP requests cause error 403 to be returned. Using non-TLS requests can leak your authentication credentials.

Verify that your client validates the server's SSL certificate. Many libraries (e.g. `urllib2` in Python2) do not validate server certificates by default. Failing to verify the server certificate makes your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack.

# [](#tag/Accounts)Accounts

All transactions on the Luno platform operate on _Accounts_. Each Account is denominated in a single currency and contains an ordered list of entries that track its running balance.

Each Account has a separate balance and available balance. The available balance may be lower than the balance if some funds have been reserved (e.g. for an open limit order). Account entries affect the balance and available balance independently.

Account entries are numbered sequentially. It is guaranteed that entries are never reordered or deleted. It is also guaranteed that the core attributes of the entry (the running balances and index) are never modified. Therefore, an Account acts as an append-only log of transactions.

## [](#tag/Accounts/operation/createAccount)Create account

This request creates an Account for the specified currency. Please note that the balances for the Account will be displayed based on the `asset` value, which is the currency the Account is based on.

Permissions required: `Perm_W_Addresses`

##### query Parameters

currencyrequired| string Example: currency=XBTThe currency code for the Account you want to create. Please see the Currency section for a detailed list of currencies supported by the Luno platform. Users must be verified to trade currency in order to be able to create an Account. For more information on the verification process, please see [How do I verify my identity?](/help/en/articles/1000168396). Users have a limit of 10 accounts per currency.

## [](#tag/Accounts/operation/ListTransactions)List transactions

Return a list of transaction entries from an account.

Transaction entry rows are numbered sequentially starting from 1, where 1 is the oldest entry. The range of rows to return are specified with the `min_row` (inclusive) and `max_row` (exclusive) parameters. At most 1000 rows can be requested per call.

If `min_row` or `max_row` is non-positive, the range wraps around the most recent row. For example, to fetch the 100 most recent rows, use `min_row=-100` and `max_row=0`.

## [](#tag/Accounts/operation/Move)Move

Move funds between two of your transactional accounts with the same currency The funds may not be moved by the time the request returns. The GET method can be used to poll for the move's status.

Note: moves will show as transactions, but not as transfers.

## [](#tag/Orders/operation/PostMarketOrder)Post Market Order

A Market Order executes immediately, and either buys as much of the asset that can be bought for a set amount of fiat currency, or sells a set amount of the asset for as much as possible.

**Warning!** Orders cannot be reversed once they have executed. Please ensure your program has been thoroughly tested before submitting Orders.

If no `base_account_id` or `counter_account_id` are specified, the default base currency or counter currency account will be used. Users can find their account IDs by calling the [Balances](#operation/getBalances) request.

Permissions required: `Perm_W_Orders`

# [](#tag/Receive)Receive

Receive addresses are used by cryptocurrencies to send assets to a specific "wallet" or user's account. They are a unique address within the blockchain, so assets sent to that address will only be associated with one wallet.

Users may have multiple receive addresses depending on the number of Accounts they have and what currency is associated with that Account.

## [](#tag/Receive/operation/getFundingAddress)Get receive address

Returns the default receive address associated with your account and the amount received via the address. Users can specify an optional address parameter to return information for a non-default receive address. In the response, `total_received` is the total confirmed amount received excluding unconfirmed transactions. `total_unconfirmed` is the total sum of unconfirmed receive transactions.

# [](#tag/Streaming-API)Streaming API

The websocket API provides streaming access to data such as market data or user data (e.g. order fills). It is more efficient and provides lower latency information than repeatedly polling the order book and recent trades, but is more complicated to implement.

The streaming protocol works by requiring the client to keep an in-memory record of the streamed data, such as the order book. Update messages are then sent from the server and the client uses these to update its copy of the order book. When applied correctly, the client's view of the order book will be identical to the server's view.

## Market stream

### Protocol

The client state consists of the following data:

  * sequence number
  * set of bid orders (id, price, volume)
  * set of ask orders (id, price, volume)
  * list of trades
  * market status



Each update message transmitted from the server has a unique increasing sequence number. The message with sequence number n can be applied to state sequence n-1 to produce state sequence n.

A message may contain multiple updates which must be applied atomically and in order.

If an update is received out-of-sequence (for example update sequence n+2 or n-1 received after update sequence n), the client cannot continue and must reinitialise the state.

There are four types of update:

  * Create 
  * Delete 
  * Trade 
  * Status 


#### Create

Add a bid or ask Order to the Order Book with a given id, price and volume. For example:
    
    
    {
      "order_id": "BXMC2CJ7HNB88U4",
      "type": "BID",
      "price": "1234.00",
      "volume": "1.23"
    }
    

#### Delete

Remove the order from the order book with a given id. For example:
    
    
    {
      "order_id": "BXMC2CJ7HNB88U4"
    }
    

#### Trade

Reduce the outstanding volume of an Order in the Order Book (`maker_order_id`) and append a Trade to the Trades List. For example:
    
    
    {
      "sequence": 24509303,
      "base": "0.1",
      "counter": "5232.00",
      "maker_order_id": "BXMC2CJ7HNB88U4",
      "taker_order_id": "BXMC2CJ7HNB88U5"
    }
    

#### Status

Set the status of the market to the given value. This field will not include the **POSTONLY** state a market is in during the 24-hour launch window. During this launch window, this status will report as **ACTIVE** , but the API will not accept orders without the **post_only** parameter set to true.
    
    
    {
      "status": "POSTONLY",
    }
    

### Examples

#### A new order is placed below market

In this case, an update message is sent with a single create update.

#### A market order is placed that is immediately filled

In this case, an update message is sent containing multiple trade updates. There will be no create update since the new order never enters the order book.

#### An order is placed that is partially filled

In this case, the update message contains multiple trade updates and a single create update. The volume in the create update is the remaining volume for the order.

#### An order is stopped

In this case, the update message contains a single delete update.

#### The market switches to post-only and trading is suspended

In this case, the update message contains a single status update.

### Websockets

The streaming updates protocol described above can be accessed using websockets. The server sends the current order book state, and then sends update messages as quickly as possible. Both the client and server must send regular keep alive messages to avoid disconnection during periods of low update message activity.

Connect to the websocket server at: `wss://ws.luno.com/api/1/stream/:pair`

The client must start by sending API key credentials:
    
    
    {
      "api_key_id": "abcdef",
      "api_key_secret": "api_key_secret_goes_here"
    }
    

The server will then send the current order book in the following format:
    
    
    {
      "sequence": "24352",
      "asks": [
        {
          "id": "BXMC2CJ7HNB88U4",
          "price": "1234.00",
          "volume": "0.93"
        }
      ],
      "bids": [
        {
          "id": "BXMC2CJ7HNB88U5",
          "price": "1201.00",
          "volume": "1.22"
        }
      ],
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "timestamp": 1528884331021
    }
    

The server then sends messages like the following:
    
    
    {
      "sequence": "24353",
      "trade_updates": null, // array of 0 or more trade updates
      "create_update": null, // null or 1 create update
      "delete_update": null, // null or 1 delete update
      "status_update": null, // null or 1 status update
      "timestamp": 1469031991
    }
    

An empty message is a _keep alive message_. Ping/Pong messages are supported.

If there is any error while processing an update (e.g. an out-of-order update) or there is a network error or timeout (e.g. keep alive message not received in time), the client should close the connection and reconnect in order to reinitialise its state. It is important that clients implement some kind of backoff to avoid being rate limited in case of errors.

## User stream

### Protocol

There are three types of update:

  * Order Status
  * Order Fill
  * Balance Update



#### Order Status

Update the status of an order. For example:
    
    
    {
      "order_id": "BXGMHMJXVEZK6NS",
      "client_order_id": "sample-XYZ",
      "market_id": "XBTZAR",
      "status": "AWAITING"
    }
    

The possible values for `status` are `AWAITING`, `PENDING` and `COMPLETE`.

#### Order Fill

Update the fill data of an order. For example:
    
    
    {
      "order_id": "BXGMHMJXVEZK6NS",
      "client_order_id": "sample-XYZ",
      "market_id": "XBTZAR",
      "base_fill": "1.00000000",
      "counter_fill": "100.00000000",
      "base_delta": "0.40000000",
      "counter_delta": "40.00000000",
      "base_fee": "0.00100000",
      "counter_fee": "0.10000000",
      "base_fee_delta": "0.00040000",
      "counter_fee_delta": "0.04000000"
    }
    

#### Balance Update

Latest account balance status:
    
    
    {
      "account_id": 8203463422864003664",
      "row_index": 1,
      "balance": "100.00000000",
      "balance_delta": "100.00000000",
      "available": "99.00000000",
      "available_delta": "1.00000000"
    }
    

### Websockets

The streaming updates protocol described above can be accessed using websockets. The server sends update messages as quickly as possible.

Connect to the websocket server at: `wss://ws.luno.com/api/1/userstream`

The client must start by sending API key credentials:
    
    
    {
      "api_key_id": "abcdef",
      "api_key_secret": "api_key_secret_goes_here"
    }
    

The server then sends messages like the following:
    
    
    {
      "type": "order_status",
      "timestamp": 1469031991,
      "order_status_update": null, // null or 1 order status update
      "order_fill_update": null, // null or 1 order fill update
      "balance_update": nill, // null or balance update
    }
    

The possible values for `type` are `order_status`, `order_fill`, `balance_update`.

Ping/Pong messages are supported.

It is important that clients implement some kind of backoff to avoid being rate limited in case of errors.

The server keeps a cache of all messages sent in the last 5 minutes. When reconnecting, messages generated while the client was disconnected will be resent to ensure messages are not missed. Note that staying disconnected for longer than 5 minutes will discard the message cache.
