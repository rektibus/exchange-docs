Introduction
Welcome
Welcome to the Crypto.com Exchange API v1 reference documentation.

The Crypto.com Exchange API v1 provides developers with a REST, and websocket API.

The majority of API calls are available across both mediums in the same request and response formats, allowing smooth transition and a reduced learning curve between the two platforms.

Where applicable, all API calls come with detailed information on both the request and response parameters, all in a simple JSON format, as well as sample requests and code snippets in JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java which can be viewed on the right.

Notes on Exchange Upgrade and API Versions

Exchange v1 API is the latest version of API which can trade Spot / Derivatives / Margin.
Derivatives v1 API has been upgraded into Exchange v1 API with additional capabilities for Spot Trading / Margin Trading / Wallet Management. As Exchange v1 API is a superset of Derivatives v1 API, existing customer can continue using the same for trading.
For full details about the exchange upgrade, please refer to this blog post with FAQ documents.
Breaking Change Schedule
On 2025-12-17 8:00 UTC,
The current trigger order creation/cancellation will be migrated to Advanced Order Management API.
On 2025-02-27 8:00 UTC,
For book.{instrument_name}.{depth}, the full snapshot subscription (book_subscription_type=SNAPSHOT) 100ms frequency is removed.
Customers wishing to continue with the faster 100ms frequency should switch to the delta subscription (book_subscription_type=SNAPSHOT_AND_UPDATE).
This higher performing subscription benefits the user with reduced bandwidth/processing compared to the snapshot subscription.
For a transition period, users subscribing to the removed 100ms snapshot will receive the 500ms subscription.

The book.{instrument_name} subscription (default depth) will be removed.
Customers should use the explicit book.{instrument_name}.{depth} subscription and specify the required depth.
For a transition period, users subscribing to the removed subscription will receive the default 50 depth subscription.


These changes will take place around 17 December 2023 8:00 UTC.
Market Data wildcard ticker subscription will be removed. Users should use the instrument specific subscription.

Common API Reference
Most of the APIs for REST and Websockets are shared, and follow the same request format and response, allowing users to easily switch between the two methods.

The Applies To section under each API allows you to see which platform supports the API.

Naming Conventions
All methods and URLs in dash-case

All parameters in snake_case

Enums in full uppercase and snake_case

Generating the API Key
Before sending any requests, you'll need to generate a new API key.

This can be done in the Exchange website under User Center - API.

After generating the key, there are two things you need to carefully note down:

API Key
Secret Key
API Key and Secret are randomly generated by the system and can not be modified. Default settings will be set to "Can Read" only, and you have the option of adding or removing certain permissions for your API Key via Web UI.

You can optionally specify a whitelist of IP addresses when generating the API Key.

If specified, the API can only be used from the whitelisted IP addresses.

REST API Root Endpoint
 Note: REST API requests need to be sent as "Content Type: application/json"
UAT Sandbox
REST API
https://uat-api.3ona.co/exchange/v1/{method}

Production
REST API
https://api.crypto.com/exchange/v1/{method}

Websocket Root Endpoints
The Websocket is available across two servers -- the User API Websocket (for authenticated requests and subscriptions), and Market Data Websocket:

UAT Sandbox
Websocket (User API and Subscriptions)
wss://uat-stream.3ona.co/exchange/v1/user

Websocket (Market Data Subscriptions)
wss://uat-stream.3ona.co/exchange/v1/market

Production
Websocket (User API and Subscriptions)
wss://stream.crypto.com/exchange/v1/user

Websocket (Market Data Subscriptions)
wss://stream.crypto.com/exchange/v1/market

Rate Limits
REST API
For authenticated calls, rate limits are per API method, per API key:

Method	Limit
private/create-order
private/cancel-order
private/cancel-all-orders	15 requests per 100ms each
private/get-order-detail	30 requests per 100ms
private/get-trades	1 requests per second
private/get-order-history	1 requests per second
All others	3 requests per 100ms each
For public market data calls, rate limits are per API method, per IP address:

Method	Limit
public/get-book
public/get-ticker
public/get-trades
public/get-valuations
public/get-candlestick
public/get-insurance	100 requests per second each
Staking
Method	Limit
public/staking/*	50 requests per second
private/staking/*	50 requests per second
Websocket
Websocket	Limit
User API	150 requests per second
Market Data	100 requests per second
private/get-trades and private/get-order-history is rate limited at 1 request per second on REST

 Important Note

We recommend adding a 1-second sleep after establishing the websocket connection, and before requests are sent.

This will avoid occurrences of rate-limit (`TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`) errors, as the websocket rate limits are pro-rated based on the calendar-second that the websocket connection was opened.
Open Order Limit
Condition	Limit
Maximum allowed open orders per trading pair per account/subaccount	200
Overall maximum allowed open orders per account/subaccount across all trading pairs	1000
Request Format
The following information applies to both REST API and websockets commands:

Name	Type	Required	Description
id	long	Y	Request Identifier
Range: 0 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
Response message will contain the same id
method	string	Y	The method to be invoked
params	object	N	Parameters for the methods
api_key	string	Depends	API key. See Digital Signature section
sig	string	Depends	Digital signature. See Digital Signature section
nonce	long	Y	Current timestamp (milliseconds since the Unix epoch)
Digital Signature
const crypto = require("crypto-js");

const signRequest = (request_body, api_key, secret) => {
  const { id, method, params, nonce } = request_body;

  function isObject(obj) { return obj !== undefined && obj !== null && obj.constructor == Object; }
  function isArray(obj) { return obj !== undefined && obj !== null && obj.constructor == Array; }
  function arrayToString(obj) { return obj.reduce((a,b) => { return a + (isObject(b) ? objectToString(b) : (isArray(b) ? arrayToString(b) : b)); }, ""); }
  function objectToString(obj) { return (obj == null ? "" : Object.keys(obj).sort().reduce((a, b) => { return a + b + (isArray(obj[b]) ? arrayToString(obj[b]) : (isObject(obj[b]) ? objectToString(obj[b]) : obj[b])); }, "")); }

  const paramsString = objectToString(params);

  console.log(paramsString);

  const sigPayload = method + id + api_key + paramsString + nonce;
  request_body.sig = crypto.HmacSHA256(sigPayload, secret).toString(crypto.enc.Hex);
};

const apiKey = "token"; /* User API Key */
const apiSecret = "secretKey"; /* User API Secret */

let request = {
  id: 11,
  method: "private/get-order-detail",
  api_key: API_KEY,
  params: {
    order_id: 53287421324
  },
  nonce: 1587846358253,
};

const requestBody = JSON.stringify(signRequest(request, apiKey, apiSecret)));
For REST API, only the private methods require a Digital Signature (as "sig") and API key (as "api_key") to be passed in. These private endpoints are only accessible by authenticated users.

For Websocket (User API), the public/auth command has to be invoked ONCE per session, with the Digital Signature (as "sig") and API key (as "api_key") as part of the request. Once authenticated, you will gain access to user-specific commands, and no longer need to use the pass in the Digital Signature and API key anymore for the duration of the session.

The authentication is based on the pairing of the API Key, along with the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request parameters using the API Secret as the cryptographic key.

 You should NEVER explicitly include the API Secret Key in plain-text in your request
The algorithm for generating the HMAC-SHA256 signature is as follows:

If "params" exist in the request, sort the request parameter keys in ascending order.

Combine all the ordered parameter keys as key + value (no spaces, no delimiters). Let's call this the parameter string

Next, do the following: method + id + api_key + parameter string + nonce

Use HMAC-SHA256 to hash the above using the API Secret as the cryptographic key

Encode the output as a hex string -- this is your Digital Signature


Since all parameters for calculating the HMAC-SHA256 hash are present in the request except the API Secret, the server-side will independently calculate the Digital Signature as well, and if done correctly, the computed hashes will match.
Besides, for JavaScript client calling `private/get-order-detail` API, it is highly recommended to use STRING format of `order_id` in the JSON request payload, in order to guarantee the correctness of Digital Signature.
Request Format
 Important Note

All numbers must be strings, and must be wrapped in double quotes. e.g. "12.34", instead of 12.34.

Error Response Format
Due to the asynchronous nature of websocket requests, a robust and consistent error response is crucial in order to match the response with the request.

To ensure API consistency for websocket error responses, if the id and method is omitted in the original request, id will have a value of -1 and method will have a value of ERROR.

The original request will be returned as an escaped string in the original field.

Advanced Order Management API
private/create-order (Conditional Order)
Conditional Orders automatically place a mark or limit order when the mark price reaches a trigger price specified by the user. If the mark price reaches or exceeds the trigger price, the Stop-Loss/Take-Profit order will be converted to a live order and placed in the order book. If the mark price does not reach the trigger price, the Stop-Loss/Take-Profit order will remain active until it is canceled or triggered.

See private/create-order and the type parameter for more information.

Request Params
Name	Type	Required	Description
instrument_name	string	Y	Staking instrument name, e.g. SOL.staked, refer to instrument_name from private/staking/get-staking-instruments response
quantity	string	Y	Unstake quantity

For yield-bearing instruments (learn more from FAQs), this field requires the quantity you wish to unstake in terms of the original staked token.

Example:
If you hold a TSTON.staked position, specify the quantity of TSTON.staked token you wish to unstake. You can retrieve the conversion rates (of TSTON to TON) from private/staking/get-swap-rate endpoint to estimate the quantity of TON you will receive after the request is successfully completed.

Websocket Subscriptions
Introduction

  "id": 1,
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "channels": ["user.order"]

}
Response Sample (Initial)

{
  "id": 1,
  "code": 0,
  "method": "subscribe"
}
One of the powerful features of a websocket is the ability to subscribe to incremental updates in particular channels.

This section covers the available channels that can be subscribed or unsubscribed for both the Websocket (User API) and Websocket (Market Data Subscriptions)

Market Data Subscriptions include features such as order book depth, all trades and ticker data.

 The Market Data Subscriptions websocket is on a separate websocket endpoint from the User API websocket.
Market Data Websocket Subscription Limits
Websocket (Market Data Subscriptions)

To better distribute system load, a single market data websocket connection is limited to a maximum of 400 subscriptions. Once this limit is reached, further subscription requests will be rejected with the EXCEED_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS error code.

A user should establish multiple connections if additional market data subscriptions are required.

Subscription Requests
Websocket subscriptions involve two responses:

An initial response to the subscribe command, which can subscribe to one or more channels

Periodic channel data for the specified channel

 Important Note

We recommend adding a 1-second sleep after establishing the websocket connection, and before requests are sent.

This will avoid occurrences of rate-limit (`TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`) errors, as the websocket rate limits are pro-rated based on the calendar-second that the websocket connection was opened.
Request Params
Name	Type	Required	Description
method	string	Y	subscribe, unsubscribe
channels	array of strings	Y	Channels to be subscribed

For websocket connections, the system will send a heartbeat message to the client every 30 seconds.

The client must respond back with the public/respond-heartbeat method, using the same matching id, within 5 seconds, or the connection will break.

Channel Parameters
Name	Description
instrument_name	Must be formal symbol. e.g. BTCUSD-PERP
depth	Maximum number of depth levels. Allowed values:
- 50
- 10
Two types of book subscription are supported:

Delta - After initial full snapshot, delta changes from the previous update are published
Snapshot - the full book depth is published for every update

Customers should prefer to use the higher performing delta subscription where possible, with benefits of reduced bandwidth/processing compared to the snapshot subscription.

Optional parameters are used for specify the subscription type:

Name	Description
book_subscription_type	The subscription type. Allowed values:
- SNAPSHOT_AND_UPDATE delta updates.
- SNAPSHOT full snapshot (default if not specified).
book_update_frequency	Book update interval in ms. Allowed values:
- 100 or 10 (default) for delta subscription.
- 500 (default) for snapshot subscription.
Response Fields
Name	Type	Description
instrument_name	string	Same as requested instrument_name
subscription	string	Same as requested channel
channel	string	book or book.update, see below
depth	string	Same as requested depth
data	array	See below
For book snapshot broadcasts, data consists of:

Name	Type	Description
bids	array	Array of level
asks	array	Array of level
tt	integer	Epoch millis of last book update
t	integer	Epoch millis of message publish
u	integer	Update sequence, See below
For book.update delta broadcasts, data consists of:

Name	Type	Description
update	object	bids and asks
tt	integer	Epoch millis of last book update
t	integer	Epoch millis of message publish
u	integer	Update sequence, See below
pu	integer	Previous update sequence, See below
level is an array:

Index	Type	Description
0	string	Price of the level
1	string	Total size of the level
2	string	Number of standing orders in the level
Upon successful subscription, a book snapshot will be sent. Subsequently behaviour is then dependent on subscription type.

For snapshot subscriptions:

A book snapshot will be published at the requested interval if the book depth has changed.
The book is always published every 500ms even if no change.
For delta subscriptions:

A book.update delta update will be published at the requested interval if the book depth has changed.
Each full snapshot/delta update has an (increasing) u field that is unique per instrument
An update should only be processed if the pu field corresponds to the u of the last received update.
If there is mismatch, the update should not be applied. Instead, re-subscribe to acquire a new full snapshot.
To re-subscribe, issue another subscribe request for the instrument. Note there is no need to issue an unsubscribe request before this.
In the case of no changes, an empty delta book.update heartbeat will be sent after 5 seconds
The levels will be empty ("asks": [], "bids": [])
The u and pu fields must be processed as above. The book may have updated outside of the requested depth, so umay have changed.
Additionally an empty delta may also be sent for update sequence housekeeping purposes. Again the u and pu must be processed as above.

To access user-specific websocket methods, public/auth has to be invoked with a valid API key and Digital Signature (refer to the Digital Signature section).

REST API calls do NOT need to do this.

 Important Note

We recommend adding a 1-second sleep after establishing the websocket connection, and before requests are sent.

This will avoid occurrences of rate-limit (`TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`) errors, as the websocket rate limits are pro-rated based on the calendar-second that the websocket connection was opened.

Cancel on Disconnect is an optional feature that will cancel all open orders created by the connection upon loss of connectivity between client or server.

This feature is only available via the Websocket.

Request Params
Name	Type	Required	Description
scope	string	Y	Specifies the scope of cancellation to be applied to the specific connection (all orders created via Websocket). The ONLY scope supported is CONNECTION
Helpful Information
Once enabled, the scope of cancellation cannot be changed or disabled for the connection.
Unsubscribing from any user channels will be considered as a loss of connectivity and will trigger cancelling orders.

Common Issues
TOO_MANY_REQUESTS After Websocket Connects
Websocket rate limits are pro-rated based on the calendar-second that the websocket connection was opened.

This means, depending on the fraction of the calendar-second that the connection was established, the rate limit could be pro-rated to a small number.

By adding a 1-second sleep after establishing the websocket connection, and before requests are sent, this will ensure the rate limit is properly reset and sync'd to your session.

This will avoid occurrences of rate-limit (TOO_MANY_REQUESTS) errors.

INVALID_NONCE On All Requests
The nonce should be the UTC Unix timestamp in milliseconds.

If this has been carefully checked, then the issue occurs when the system clock of the client machine is greater than 60 seconds in the future / past.

Usually, re-syncing with the NTP time server on the client machine will correct the issue.

If the issue persists, you can try deliberately subtracting N seconds from the nonce to force it to be N seconds in the past, which is still within the 60-second past tolerance.
