Overview
Welcome to the Phemex API documentation. We offer REST and Websocket APIs to interact with our systems.

General API information
vip user endpoints (for whitelisted client IPs only):
Rest API: https://vapi.phemex.com
Websocket: wss://vapi.phemex.com/ws
public user endpoints:
Rest API: https://api.phemex.com
Websocket (further URI or querystring not allowed): wss://ws.phemex.com
testnet user endpoints:
Rest API: https://testnet-api.phemex.com
Websocket: wss://testnet-api.phemex.com/ws
Phemex provides HTTP Rest API for client to operate orders, all endpoints return a JSON object.
REST API Standards
HTTP return codes
HTTP 401 return code is used when unauthenticated
HTTP 403 return code is used when lack of priviledge.
HTTP 429 return code is used when breaking a request ratelimit.
HTTP 5XX return codes are used for Phemex internal errors. Note: This doesn't means the operation failed, the execution status is UNKNOWN and could be Succeed.
REST request header
Every HTTP Rest Request must have the following Headers:

x-phemex-access-token : This is API-KEY (id field) from Phemex site.
x-phemex-request-expiry : This describes the Unix EPoch SECONDS to expire the request, normally it should be (Now() + 1 minute)
x-phemex-request-signature : This is HMAC SHA256 signature of the http request. Secret is API Secret, its formula is : HMacSha256(URL Path + QueryString + Expiry + body)
(Optional) x-phemex-request-tracing: a unique string to trace http-request, less than 40 bytes. This header is a must in resolving latency issues.
Endpoint security type
Each API call must be signed and pass to server in HTTP header x-phemex-request-signature.
Endpoints use HMAC SHA256 signatures. The HMAC SHA256 signature is a keyed HMAC SHA256 operation. Use your apiSecret as the key and the string URL Path + QueryString + Expiry + body ) as the value for the HMAC operation.
The signature is case sensitive.

REST response format
Response general format

{
  "code": <code>,
  "msg": <msg>,
  "data": <data>
}
All restful API except starting with /md shares same response format.
Field	Description
code	0 means success, non-zero means error
msg	when code is non-zero, it gives short error description
data	operation dependant
Rate limits
In order to protect the exchange, Phemex apply API RateLimit and IP Ratelimit on all requests.
Rest API has a request capacity in one minute window on user basis.
IP has request capacity in 5 minutes window.
Ratelimit of API is independant of that in WEB/APP, so if one get ratelimited in API, one can place/cancel orders via WEB or APP.
all requests to the domain testnet-api.phemex.com shared across the rate limit 500/5m in total.
IP ratelimits
Currently Phemex restricts every IP 5,000 requests in 5 minutes window. If exceeded this IP capacity, the user would be blocked in the following 5 minutes.
wss://ws.phemex.com 200/5m per IP address, not mandatory to bind IP or get whitelisted.
REST API ratelimit rules
Order spamming limitations
All Phemex APIs are divided into 3 groups, contract, spotOrder and others.
All APIs in the same group share a request capacity.
Every API consume request shares at its own weight.
If exceeded the ratelimit, http status 429 will returned, together with a reset seconds header x-ratelimit-retry-after-<groupName>
Ratelimit headers Below headers are returned with API response. Postfix -<groupName> is empty if group is others
Header name	Description
x-ratelimit-remaining-groupName	Remaining request permits in this minute
x-ratelimit-capacity-groupName	Request ratelimit capacity
x-ratelimit-retry-after-groupName	Reset timeout in seconds for current ratelimited user
Group capacity
Group Name	Capacity
Contract	500/minute
SpotOrder	500/minute
Others	100/minute
New Contract API RateLimit Rules (for VAPI/VIP only)
Contract API currently employs new rate-limit rules based on symbols, according to Phemex internal configuration of uid individually.
Under the new throttling rules, Contract API consumes both contract group capacity (5000/minute) and symbol group capacity (500/minute) at the same time, but the each capacity of different symbols are independent from one another.
Contract API that may involve all symbols like 'cancel all' consumes request capacity under a special group named 'CONTACT_ALL_SYM'.

Ratelimit headers added in the symbol dimension.

Header name	Description
x-ratelimit-remaining-groupName_symbol	Remaining request ratelimit in the symbol group in this minute
x-ratelimit-capacity-groupName_symbol	Total request capacity in the symbol group
x-ratelimit-retry-after-groupName_symbol	Reset timeout in seconds for current ratelimited user in the symbol group

COIN-M Perpetual REST API

Query product information
Request

GET /public/products
COIN-M perpetual contracts using COIN as margin
Contract symbols are defined in .products[] with type=Perpetual.
Contract risklimit information are defined in .risklimits[].
Contract which delisted has status with 'Delisted' .
Request/Response field explanation
Leverage
The absolute value of leverageEr determines initial-margin-rate, i.e. initialMarginRate = 1/abs(leverage)
The sign of leverageEr indicates margin mode, i.e. leverage <= 0 means cross-margin-mode, leverage > 0 means isolated-margin-mode.
The result of setting leverageEr to 0 is leverage to maximum leverage supported by user selected risklimit, and margin-mode is cross-margin-mode.
Cross margin mode
Position margin includes two parts, one part is balance assigned to position, another part is account available balance.
Position in cross-margin-mode may be affected by other position, because account available balance is shared among all positions in cross mode.
Isolated margin mode
Position margin only includes balance assgined to position, by default it is initial-margin.
Position in isolatd-margin-mode is independent of other positions.
Price/Ratio/Value scales
Fields with post-fix "Ep", "Er" or "Ev" have been scaled based on symbol setting.

Fields with post-fix "Ep" are scaled prices, priceScale in products
Fields with post-fix "Er" are scaled ratios, ratioScale in products
Fields with post-fix "Ev" are scaled values, valueScale of settleCurrency in products

More order type examples
Stop-loss orders are with ordType = Stop/StopLimit. And Take-profit orders are with ordType = MarketIfTouched/LimitIfTouched.
Stop-loss order is triggered when price moves against order-side(buy/sell), while Take-profit order is triggered when price moves in profitable direction to order-side(buy/sell).
Order Type	Side	Parameter requirements	Trigger condition
Stop/StopLimit	Sell	stopPxEp < last-price/mark-price	last/mark-price <= stopPxEp
Stop/StopLimit	Buy	stopPxEp > last-price/mark-price	last/mark-price >= stopPxEp
MarketIfTouched/LimitIfTouched	Sell	stopPxEp > last-price/mark-price	last/mark-price >= stopPxEp
MarketIfTouched/LimitIfTouched	Buy	stopPxEp < last-price/mark-price	last/mark-price <= stopPxEp

Field	Type	Description	Possible values
currency	String	trading account's settle currency. Use to identify trading account.	BTC, USD, ETH
 unRealizedPnlEv is not up to date and needs to be calculated in client side with latest markPrice. The formula is as below.
Inverse long contract: unRealizedPnl = (posSize * contractSize) / avgEntryPrice - (posSize * contractSize) / markPrice
Inverse short contract: unRealizedPnl =  (posSize *contractSize) / markPrice - (posSize * contractSize) / avgEntryPrice
Linear long contract:  unRealizedPnl = (posSize * contractSize) * markPrice - (posSize * contractSize) * avgEntryPrice
Linear short contract:  unRealizedPnl = (posSize * contractSize) * avgEntryPrice - (posSize * contractSize) * markPrice

posSize is a signed vaule. contractSize is a fixed value.

The API return latest position unrealized pnl with considerable cost, thus its ratelimit weight is very high.

 For better performance and latency, highly recommend calculating unRealizedPnlEv in client side with latest markPrice to avoid ratelimit penalty.

How to manage local orderbook? 1, After subscribing to the incremental load push (such as books 5 levels) of Order Book Channel, users firstreceive the initial full load of market depth. After the incremental load is subsequently received, update thelocal full load. 2, lf there is the same price, compare the size. lf the size is 0, delete this depth data. lf the size changes replace the original data. (noted that if the price is within depth and the size is unchagned, the level will NOT published by incremental updates) 3, lf it is not same price, sort by price (bid in descending order, ask in ascending order), and insert the depth information into the full load. 4, Sort updated orderbook and keep top 5 levels (noted that the old price levels that falls behind the top 5 levels will not update anymore untill it comes back to top 5 levels).

HTTP Request:
Request fields are the same as above place-order

Order creation supports self trade prevention (STP).
Contact the Phemex support to enable stpGroupId for your account.
Once stpGroupId is enabled, the parent account and sub-accounts will, by default, share the same stpGroupId.
Users ONLY need to provide stpInstruction as an order parameter; the stpGroupId is automatically assigned once enabled.
The stpInstruction in the taker order will have the priority to determine STP action when STP is triggered and both taker and maker orders have stpInstruction set.
Both stpGroupId and stpInstruction are required to activate STP.

Set RiskLimit
Risk Limit Modification Notice: For hedged contracts, the 'Set Position Risk Limit API' has been deprecated. It is no longer possible to manually set the 'Risk Limit'. Instead, simply adjust the leverage multiplier as required, and the 'Risk Limit' will be automatically adjusted.

New Risk Limit Configuration Explanation: A new attribute called leverageMargin has been added to the properties of symbol pairs. By locating the corresponding index_id within the leverageMargins node, one can find the associated 'Risk Limit' information. The configuration is as follows:

Configuration

{
  "index_id": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "notionalValueRv": 50000,

How to manage local orderbook? 1, After subscribing to the incremental load push (such as books 5 levels) of Order Book Channel, users firstreceive the initial full load of market depth. After the incremental load is subsequently received, update thelocal full load. 2, lf there is the same price, compare the size. lf the size is 0, delete this depth data. lf the size changes replace the original data. (noted that if the price is within depth and the size is unchagned, the level will NOT published by incremental updates) 3, lf it is not same price, sort by price (bid in descending order, ask in ascending order), and insert the depth information into the full load. 4, Sort updated orderbook and keep top 5 levels (noted that the old price levels that falls behind the top 5 levels will not update anymore untill it comes back to top 5 levels).

RiskUnit is the unit of risk evaluation, which contains summary information of positions or assets within its scope. Each user must have at least one main riskMode riskunit, which could be Classic or MultiAsset. Besides the main riskMode, user may have isolated riskMode riskunits.

Classic RiskMode This is the main riskMode type. Each type of contract (for example, usdt contract, btc inverse contract, eth inverse contract etc) has its own risk unit in Classic riskMode, with a scope to evaluate the risk summary of all cross positions in a this contract. User in this mode would trade different contracts separately, which means each contract has its own balance, risk evaluation and liquidation process.
The unique key of such risk unit is:
{ riskMode : Classic , valuationCurrency : {thisContractSettleCcy} , symbol :{thisContractMajorSymbol}, posSide :0 }

MultiAsset RiskMode: This is another main risk mode type. Each type of contract (for example, usdt contract, btc inverse contract, eth inverse contract etc) has its own risk unit in MultiAsset riskMode, with a scope to evaluate the risk summary of all cross positions in this contract. Although each risk unit in each contract has a separate liquidation process, assets or balance in one contract can be used as collaterals to another contract, thus risk evaluation could be correlated. For example, the margin ratio of the btc contract risk unit can change because part of its balance is used as collateral for usdt contract positions.
The unique key of such riskunit is:
{ riskMode : MultiAsset , valuationCurrency : {thisContractSettleCcy} , symbol :{thisContractMajorSymbol}, posSide :0 }

Isolated RiskMode: This is not a main risk mode type, so user doesnot necessarily have this riskunits under the main mode. When user has one riskuni tin IsolatedriskMode, it will be related to one isolated position.
The unique key of such riskunit is:
{ riskMode : Isolated , valuationCurrency : {isolatedPosSettleCcy} , symbol :{isolatedPosSymbol}, posSide :{isolatedPosSide} }

RAS subscription requires the session been authorized successfully. DataGW extracts the user information from the given token and sends RAS messages back to client accordingly. Latest account snapshot messages will be sent to client immediately on subscription, and incremental messages will be sent for later updates. Each account snapshot contains one risk unit for cross margin positions, and each one risk unit for each isolated position. And also one risk wallet for each currency.

Spot REST API
Endpoint security type
Each API call must be signed and pass to server in HTTP header x-phemex-request-signature.
Endpoints use HMAC SHA256 signatures. The HMAC SHA256 signature is a keyed HMAC SHA256 operation. Use your apiSecret as the key and the string URL Path + QueryString + Expiry + body ) as the value for the HMAC operation.
The signature is case sensitive.
Query product information

Price/Ratio/Value scales
Fields with post-fix "Ep", "Er" or "Ev" have been scaled based on symbol setting.

Fields with post-fix "Ep" are scaled prices, priceScale in products
Fields with post-fix "Er" are scaled ratios, ratioScale in products
Fields with post-fix "Ev" are scaled values, valueScale of settleCurrency in products
NOTE:
1) ratioScale is always scaled 8.
2) priceScale follows the valueScale of quote-currency, and must follow quote-ticksize criteria.
e.g. priceScale of sBTCUSDT follows USDT-valueScale, i.e. 1e8; the scaled price of sBTCUSDT must be multiple times of quoteTickSizeEv=1e6.
3) qtySale follows the valueScale of base-currency, and must follow base-tickSize criteria.
e.g. qtyScale of sETHUSDT follows ETH-valueScale, i.e. 1e8; the scaled qty of sETHUSDT must be mulitple times of baseTickSizeEv=10000.

Other API
Other APIs listed below are not changed and should be same as before * Transfer API * CreateOrder API * ReplaceOrder API * AssignIsolatedBalance API * WebSocket Related API

The data and interface of websocket are same as before. But in SingleAsset mode, users may subscribe to AOPS (see https://phemex-docs.github.io/#subscribe-account-order-position-aop-2) to get the latest balance and positions. In MultiAsset mode, users need to subscribe to RAS (see https://phemex-docs.github.io/#subscribe-account-margin-rasO) to get the latest asset info in different currencies, while positions still need to get from AOPS
